# CS 061: Machine Organization and Assembly Language Programming

## Course Description

CS 061 covers a broad range of topics essential for understanding the organization and operation of computers. The key areas of focus include:

- **Number Representation**: Understanding how numbers are represented in different numeral systems, including binary, octal, hexadecimal, and decimal.
- **Combinational and Sequential Logic**: Learning the basics of logic gates, circuits, and how they form the building blocks of digital systems.
- **Computer Instructions**: Exploring the types of instructions executed by a CPU and how they are structured.
- **Memory Organization**: Delving into the structure and management of memory within a computer system.
- **Addressing Modes**: Understanding the various ways to address memory locations.
- **Interrupts**: Learning about the interrupt mechanism and how it is used for handling I/O operations and other asynchronous events.
- **Input/Output (I/O)**: Studying the methods and protocols for transferring data between the CPU and peripheral devices.
- **Assembly Language Programming**: Gaining hands-on experience with low-level programming using LC-3 Assembly.
- **Assemblers and Linkers**: Understanding the tools and processes that translate assembly language code into machine code and link various modules to create executable programs.
